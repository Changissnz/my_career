# Finding a Career

I have had a great influx of thoughts ever since becoming 
a full-time member of the U.S. labor market system after 
obtaining an undergraduate degree. On the plus side, the
proportion of jobs that require few qualifications are 
bountiful. The communication protocols put in place during
the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, which includes Zoom and 
other teleconferencing technology, facilitated contact 
for prospective employees and enabled them to find remote 
work better. 

I have never viewed the I.T. industry as apparatuses 
that operate in a completely secure and puritanical 
light. So when I read some of the events in the papers 
about the I.T. industry with regards to data security 
(for the privacy of customers and citizens), stability 
of work in the industry, and new initiatives spearheaded 
for ominous initiatives such as military intelligence,
I knew that entry into the so-called prestige of I.T. 
business and service requires the initiative to navigate 
the labor market, alongside skill, credentials, and 
some luck. 

About a week or so again, I saw a headline titled 
something like "A.I. Bust", and it comes as no surprise 
to me. Big Tech industry has taken an oversized role as 
a topic for conversation and in usually very positive 
terms as well although distressing events such as layoffs 
occurred. Ultimately, through my personal experience as 
a participant in the labor market, I have become very 
desensitized to the ongoing chronicles of appall and 
brilliance that come from the Californian hubs 
constituting "Silicon Valley". It is difficult for 
me to send out more applications to big-name companies 
developing digital products (the trend is now A.I.), 
all the while reading daily articles on labor strikes, 
and getting no response. Another point that has added 
to my loss of interest in digital technology jobs is 
that many of the jobs are very service-oriented. The 
efficiency that technology can bring is made more 
evident by how people streamline and use the products 
in mass formation. So if I.T. jobs are part of the 
services sector of the economy, and there are problems 
such as data security involved, then maybe these jobs 
are not so great. I guess that is why there have been 
frequent references to the dot-com bubble burst that 
happened more than two decades ago. 

I happen to think these technological and labor shifts 
to accomodate digital products/activities have obviously 
not yielded many benefits to some groups of people. Instead, 
these shifts are more so recirculation of wealth between
members of privatized social circles. The persuasion of 
tales of information technology substantially improving 
conditions overall carries too much commercial zeal on the 
one hand, and too much collectivist utopian rumination on 
the other hand, to be more credible than the awe it 
triggers in those under naivette. A lot of modern digital 
technology is distributed by limited liability companies, 
and that really speaks a lot for the U.S. approach to data 
privacy in comparison to its European Union counterparts 
with their GDPR. Cyber-security companies are not transparent 
because they are in the business of security. The failures to 
guard databases and intellectual property have become 
typical tales of the I.T. industry in relation to healthcare, 
war, politics, and daily life in industrialized countries. 
Information games in hacking, leaking information, forging 
of documents and materials have made the I.T. programmer 
take to the back-stage because they do not seem to be the 
most crucial workers in businesses or organizations that 
deal in information for whatever specific purposes to 
meddle in the lives and affairs of people involved in 
the information material that they (the business or 
organization) claim to own.

Today, after I have recollected some of the events in the 
I.T. industry in the scope of my job search, I can state 
that I do not feel like I am missing out on anything great
going on with I.T. and A.I. given trends such as "crypto 
winter" and digital technologies primed for military 
conflicts (ongoing or planned for future). But I am 
continuing to make solid efforts to steer clear away 
from Florida, because I was given low-pay on top of 
social ills and inconveniences there. One thing I have 
discovered in the jungle of the U.S. economic system 
with its many unnecessary regulations, usually against 
those from disadvantaged backgrounds, is that the labor 
market does make active efforts to subvert those that 
"seem" vulnerable enough to be picked on, similar to 
the dynamics of bullying between people. The labor 
market does not care about a person's intelligence 
or the specific skills they acquired past a certain 
point. In labor, the worker is more of a function than 
a really thoughtful and sentimental person with many 
things to give and share. 

For example, I cannot believe that looking back, 
that I was living off so little by the low-pay work 
positions I took up during and after graduating from 
college. I became practically glued to the meaningless
and trivial jobs that the South Florida suburban sprawl 
had to offer. Why would I devote any more than one year 
of my life to higher education to work any of those jobs? 
I would not have needed even a high-school diploma. 
The reason is simple to understand. I could not seem 
to fetch one of those white-collar jobs working in 
digital technology that was so advertised as being 
the future. Now, I see why. The I.T. industry likes to 
appear credible by acting immaculate and ethical 
(all the while encouraging so-called security companies 
to engage in information warfare scenarios). There 
have been security concerns announced about the 
industry, and ongoing conflicts in the Eastern 
hemisphere add more stress and complication to the 
job search in the digital industry. 

I have also tuned in less to the press, especially 
when it comes to economics. The economists on major 
news stations do not really have honest ideas to share. 
If they do have honest ideas, then the ideas might be 
of no use to the specific rigors of typical workers. 

# I.T., Security, and a Host of Problems

I have especially felt the draining and negative 
influence of malicious use of information that may 
or may not be entirely fabricated (or engineered, 
whatever word suits the speaker better). It does 
not even have to be personal. A.I.-web enhanced 
advertising (targeted programming) is the big 
commercial model. Besides from that, when I 
consume too much media sometimes, I get a feeling
of sensory/cognitive overload. 

The broad nature of automating or streamlining 
memory-based tasks or memory storage is why 
emerging information technologies are becoming 
another department or renovated departments in 
other industries that traditionally 
do not deal in or have integrated digital systems. 
There is also a lot of potential for abuse of 
information, obviously. Institutions such 
as police, defense industry, tabloids, and 
monopolists are a few noteworthy players. 
Information as a good can be used to plan out 
or announce malice from one party to another. 
The presentation of valuable information carries 
a lot of weight, at least as much weight as 
whatever truth behind the information. And the 
roles and persons designated these responsibilities
can be put into question from time to time, 
especially if there are political or financial 
incentives involved. 

# Why Not Florida For I.T.?

If I were to ever go into information technology 
as a businessperson, Florida would be one of the 
last destinations. I became very disenfranchised 
with my prospects as a Florida citizen before 
the Republican Party pushed for the state to 
become a stronghold in the bipolar national 
political machine (circa 2016). I was struggling 
in undergraduate courses to major in chemistry. 
I never majored in chemistry after failing organic 
chemistry. Back in Florida, I became a sort of 
sitting duck flunkie student loser, alone with 
my own thoughts but not really since I was 
still financially dependent. After my internship 
at Blackberry Cylance in summer of 2019 where I 
programmed an extension for a data analysis engine, 
I became very dry out of luck as a prospective 
software engineer. I did not land interviews. I read 
daily articles about the COVID pandemic's cultural 
effects on the workplaces of Modernia. The parts 
of my hometown that were not occupied by wealthy 
retirees were still stuck in their ways of 
drug use (pharmaceutical pill abuse) and other 
typical vices associated with blue-collar 
malfeasance. Instead of obtaining a job as another 
"tech worker", I took up work that required 
measly education and barely any skill. Perhaps 
if I had went to law school, I could have worked 
for organizations such as Morgan and Morgan or 
Southern Poverty Law Center. I would have 
probably wielded more influence in South Florida
if I had graduated as a law student.

Florida has a culture problem that became more 
evident after the governor's spat with Disney 
(part of or the cause of so-called culture 
wars). Florida has too many retirees, odd fixations,
tourism, and swing-state politics to make for a good 
spot for I.T. business. 

Besides, with I.T. business, I am sure that fiscal 
problems have enabled people (or should I say, people 
have resorted to) to delve into the more ethically 
questionable aspects of I.T. business, such as 
extortion, blackmail, identity theft, defamation 
on the civil side. On the more violent side, there 
is information warfare, a precursor or complementary 
set of principles alongside other forms of war.

There is a large population in the state of 
Florida, but from a commercial information 
aspect, it would be better to operate in 
another state to serve Florida residents 
I.T. products than operate those I.T. products
in the state of Florida. Crowding and suburban 
sprawl is a problem in Florida, and the state
does not have as much investiture in past or 
present public infrastructure. 

# The So-Called Information Age

Information technology as an industry of workers 
appears very attractive to demographics that have 
a higher-than-average literacy. But obviously, during
some recent periods in stock market history, there 
have been events that have skewed the demands for 
labor in this economic sector towards equilibria that 
are not impartial in selection. For example, during 
this time period in the U.S. (since approximately 2020), 
many parts of the I.T. industry have reorganized 
themselves to accomodate for demand related to the 
conflicts involving Israel and Ukraine. 

The sector of information technology carries 
with it an air of elitism due to the typically 
bureaucratic and begrudging path towards netting
a job working in it. There are certainly some priorities
deemed more important than others with regards to 
security, project planning, monetary compensation, 
and marketing. Stiff competition and other market 
issues such as supply-chain disruption have given 
me the backseat when it comes to being a cog in 
the information technology machine complex. 

There is something very awful about the nature 
of competition when some variables go downhill, 
metaphorically speaking. For example, some things 
do not get fully revealed, per se, until there is 
loss that is not able to be compensated. Or the 
path towards competition is very restrictive and 
already somewhat deterministic, so much that the 
first competition is being able to get to the 
real competition. What makes things worse is that 
some competitions end early, and the winners 
claim lifelong legitimacy and supremacy.

I expect that since there are unscrupulous 
dealers of all sorts of goods, including 
information, that the business of information
technology is susceptible to questionable 
tendencies. I stay tuned to these trends, 
and I do not mind.
