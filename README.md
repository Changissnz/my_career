# Finding a Career

I have had a great influx of thoughts ever since becoming 
a full-time member of the U.S. labor market system after 
obtaining an undergraduate degree. On the plus side, the
proportion of jobs that require few qualifications are 
bountiful. The communication protocols put in place during
the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, which includes Zoom and 
other teleconferencing technology, facilitated contact 
for prospective employees and enabled them to find remote 
work better. 

I have never viewed the I.T. industry as apparatuses 
that operate in a completely secure and puritanical 
light. So when I read some of the events in the papers 
about the I.T. industry with regards to data security 
(for the privacy of customers and citizens), stability 
of work in the industry, and new initiatives spearheaded 
for ominous initiatives such as military intelligence,
I knew that entry into the so-called prestige of I.T. 
business and service requires the initiative to navigate 
the labor market, alongside skill, credentials, and 
some luck. 

About a week or so again, I saw a headline titled 
something like "A.I. Bust", and it comes as no surprise 
to me. Big Tech industry has taken an oversized role as 
a topic for conversation and in usually very positive 
terms as well although distressing events such as layoffs 
occurred. Ultimately, through my personal experience as 
a participant in the labor market, I have become very 
desensitized to the ongoing chronicles of appall and 
brilliance that come from the Californian hubs 
constituting "Silicon Valley". It is difficult for 
me to send out more applications to big-name companies 
developing digital products (the trend is now A.I.), 
all the while reading daily articles on labor strikes, 
and getting no response. Another point that has added 
to my loss of interest in digital technology jobs is 
that many of the jobs are very service-oriented. The 
efficiency that technology can bring is made more 
evident by how people streamline and use the products 
in mass formation. So if I.T. jobs are part of the 
services sector of the economy, and there are problems 
such as data security involved, then maybe these jobs 
are not so great. I guess that is why there have been 
frequent references to the dot-com bubble burst that 
happened more than two decades ago. 

I happen to think these technological and labor shifts 
to accomodate digital products/activities have obviously 
not yielded many benefits to some groups of people. Instead, 
these shifts are more so recirculation of wealth between
members of privatized social circles. The persuasion of 
tales of information technology substantially improving 
conditions overall carries too much commercial zeal on the 
one hand, and too much collectivist utopian rumination on 
the other hand, to be more credible than the awe it 
triggers in those under naivette. A lot of modern digital 
technology is distributed by limited liability companies, 
and that really speaks a lot for the U.S. approach to data 
privacy in comparison to its European Union counterparts 
with their GDPR. Cyber-security companies are not transparent 
because they are in the business of security. The failures to 
guard databases and intellectual property have become 
typical tales of the I.T. industry in relation to healthcare, 
war, politics, and daily life in industrialized countries. 
Information games in hacking, leaking information, forging 
of documents and materials have made the I.T. programmer 
take to the back-stage because they do not seem to be the 
most crucial workers in businesses or organizations that 
deal in information for whatever specific purposes to 
meddle in the lives and affairs of people involved in 
the information material that they (the business or 
organization) claim to own.

Today, after I have recollected some of the events in the 
I.T. industry in the scope of my job search, I can state 
that I do not feel like I am missing out on anything great
going on with I.T. and A.I. given trends such as "crypto 
winter" and digital technologies primed for military 
conflicts (ongoing or planned for future). But I am 
continuing to make solid efforts to steer clear away 
from Florida, because I was given low-pay on top of 
social ills and inconveniences there. One thing I have 
discovered in the jungle of the U.S. economic system 
with its many unnecessary regulations, usually against 
those from disadvantaged backgrounds, is that the labor 
market does make active efforts to subvert those that 
"seem" vulnerable enough to be picked on, similar to 
the dynamics of bullying between people. The labor 
market does not care about a person's intelligence 
or the specific skills they acquired past a certain 
point. In labor, the worker is more of a function than 
a really thoughtful and sentimental person with many 
things to give and share. 

For example, I cannot believe that looking back, 
that I was living off so little by the low-pay work 
positions I took up during and after graduating from 
college. I became practically glued to the meaningless
and trivial jobs that the South Florida suburban sprawl 
had to offer. Why would I devote any more than one year 
of my life to higher education to work any of those jobs? 
I would not have needed even a high-school diploma. 
The reason is simple to understand. I could not seem 
to fetch one of those white-collar jobs working in 
digital technology that was so advertised as being 
the future. Now, I see why. The I.T. industry likes to 
appear credible by acting immaculate and ethical 
(all the while encouraging so-called security companies 
to engage in information warfare scenarios). There 
have been security concerns announced about the 
industry, and ongoing conflicts in the Eastern 
hemisphere add more stress and complication to the 
job search in the digital industry. 

I have also tuned in less to the press, especially 
when it comes to economics. The economists on major 
news stations do not really have honest ideas to share. 
If they do have honest ideas, then the ideas might be 
of no use to the specific rigors of typical workers. 

# I.T., Security, and a Host of Problems

I have especially felt the draining and negative 
influence of malicious use of information that may 
or may not be entirely fabricated (or engineered, 
whatever word suits the speaker better). It does 
not even have to be personal. A.I.-web enhanced 
advertising (targeted programming) is the big 
commercial model. Besides from that, when I 
consume too much media sometimes, I get a feeling
of sensory/cognitive overload. 

The broad nature of automating or streamlining 
memory-based tasks or memory storage is why 
emerging information technologies are becoming 
another department or renovated departments in 
other industries that traditionally 
do not deal in or have integrated digital systems. 
There is also a lot of potential for abuse of 
information, obviously. Institutions such 
as police, defense industry, tabloids, and 
monopolists are a few noteworthy players. 
Information as a good can be used to plan out 
or announce malice from one party to another. 
The presentation of valuable information carries 
a lot of weight, at least as much weight as 
whatever truth behind the information. And the 
roles and persons designated these responsibilities
can be put into question from time to time, 
especially if there are political or financial 
incentives involved. 

# Why Not Florida For I.T.?

If I were to ever go into information technology 
as a businessperson, Florida would be one of the 
last destinations. I became very disenfranchised 
with my prospects as a Florida citizen before 
the Republican Party pushed for the state to 
become a stronghold in the bipolar national 
political machine (circa 2016). I was struggling 
in undergraduate courses to major in chemistry. 
I never majored in chemistry after failing organic 
chemistry. Back in Florida, I became a sort of 
sitting duck flunkie student loser, alone with 
my own thoughts but not really since I was 
still financially dependent. After my internship 
at Blackberry Cylance in summer of 2019 where I 
programmed an extension for a data analysis engine, 
I became very dry out of luck as a prospective 
software engineer. I did not land interviews. I read 
daily articles about the COVID pandemic's cultural 
effects on the workplaces of Modernia. The parts 
of my hometown that were not occupied by wealthy 
retirees were still stuck in their ways of 
drug use (pharmaceutical pill abuse) and other 
typical vices associated with blue-collar 
malfeasance. Instead of obtaining a job as another 
"tech worker", I took up work that required 
measly education and barely any skill. Perhaps 
if I had went to law school, I could have worked 
for organizations such as Morgan and Morgan or 
Southern Poverty Law Center. I would have 
probably wielded more influence in South Florida
if I had graduated as a law student.

Florida has a culture problem that became more 
evident after the governor's spat with Disney 
(part of or the cause of so-called culture 
wars). Florida has too many retirees, odd fixations,
tourism, and swing-state politics to make for a good 
spot for I.T. business. 

Besides, with I.T. business, I am sure that fiscal 
problems have enabled people (or should I say, people 
have resorted to) to delve into the more ethically 
questionable aspects of I.T. business, such as 
extortion, blackmail, identity theft, defamation 
on the civil side. On the more violent side, there 
is information warfare, a precursor or complementary 
set of principles alongside other forms of war.

There is a large population in the state of 
Florida, but from a commercial information 
aspect, it would be better to operate in 
another state to serve Florida residents 
I.T. products than operate those I.T. products
in the state of Florida. Crowding and suburban 
sprawl is a problem in Florida, and the state
does not have as much investiture in past or 
present public infrastructure. 

# The So-Called Information Age

Information technology as an industry of workers 
appears very attractive to demographics that have 
a higher-than-average literacy. But obviously, during
some recent periods in stock market history, there 
have been events that have skewed the demands for 
labor in this economic sector towards equilibria that 
are not impartial in selection. For example, during 
this time period in the U.S. (since approximately 2020), 
many parts of the I.T. industry have reorganized 
themselves to accomodate for demand related to the 
conflicts involving Israel and Ukraine. 

The sector of information technology carries 
with it an air of elitism due to the typically 
bureaucratic and begrudging path towards netting
a job working in it. There are certainly some priorities
deemed more important than others with regards to 
security, project planning, monetary compensation, 
and marketing. Stiff competition and other market 
issues such as supply-chain disruption have given 
me the backseat when it comes to being a cog in 
the information technology machine complex. 

There is something very awful about the nature 
of competition when some variables go downhill, 
metaphorically speaking. For example, some things 
do not get fully revealed, per se, until there is 
loss that is not able to be compensated. Or the 
path towards competition is very restrictive and 
already somewhat deterministic, so much that the 
first competition is being able to get to the 
real competition. What makes things worse is that 
some competitions end early, and the winners 
claim lifelong legitimacy and supremacy.

I expect that since there are unscrupulous 
dealers of all sorts of goods, including 
information, that the business of information
technology is susceptible to questionable 
tendencies. I stay tuned to these trends, 
and I do not mind. 

# I.T.,A.I.,and Corporatism

There are strong ties between corporatist 
labor forces and the I.T./A.I. high-tech 
industry, in which the term "high-tech" 
takes to mean the most advanced segment 
of a technology goods production machine.
Without silicon, without the water that 
you need for yourself, A.I. would still 
be like the most magical and powerful 
algorithm invented by Ava Lovelace, 
pretty cool and advanced ideas for the 
time but way ahead for the time. 

There are probably issues down the road 
depending on the demands of the labor 
market coupled with the demands from 
labor market participants, with regards 
to the rankings and progressions in 
organizations related to the adoption, 
production, and distribution of "high-tech" 
products. 

Back when I was still in college, I 
anticipated my road ahead after 
graduation would not be met with 
applause and embrace, with me comfortably 
handed a mathematics-related job in 
the services sector of the economy. 
And I was right because I knew with 
some aspects of my life, I would be 
given sub-par. Leadership dynamics 
in organizations continue to change 
or lean towards preferences, so 
people in my position do continue to 
look for entry into the higher-paid 
end of the labor market. There are 
bound to be recurring issues in 
conversation about topics that cannot 
be so easily changed. For example, I 
would be a fool to discard what I 
studied in school or to not continue 
to pursue knowledge and skill regarding
academic topics of interest. Even if 
I continue to net jobs that require 
very little college-level mathematics, 
there is always a little time that 
can be put aside for hobbies involving
intellectual interests.

I was thinking about the subtle but 
clearly existent classism in the 
labor market, especially when it 
comes to the supply-chain in the 
technology sector. Back in school, 
even before higher education, students
such as I were introduced to ideas 
against some manifestations of labor 
in the capital economy. Dissatisfaction 
is a feeling I have felt from time to 
time, but ultimately, better work, 
better development, and a better life 
is a personal waiting game. 

The term "corporatism" is, easily 
enough, a very fitting term for 
some organizational structures that 
require advanced and regulated 
pipelines of labor and production. 
For example, a university student 
researcher in artificial intelligence
may not think that they are a 
corporatist because they are bossing
around no one and not enforcing any 
policy. But the work that they 
do gets translated into computer 
programming that is software 
embedded into computing devices. 
And those computing devices started 
off as raw materials. So the student
researcher is actually a sort of 
gem in the crown that is the 
production machine for artificial 
intelligence embedded into hardware.
And the production machine can be 
considered corporatist because the 
rules and regulations regarding
utility and work follow rigid 
hierarchical processes. 

One aspect about corporatism that 
really sticks out to me is the 
financial welfare of those that do 
not labor in the corporatist structure.
A few centuries back, the British 
with their East India Company was able 
to establish and build a dominance 
in South Asia. The structure of this 
company, according to the incomplete 
facts that I have read, can be 
considered corporatist due to the 
wealth and power distribution regarding
the company. The East India Company made 
a lot of money, but many of Britain's 
subjects (those of Indian or British origin)
were not financially better off due to 
the successes of the company. Bear in 
mind that during the time period of 
the East India Company, mass changes in 
labor occurred in the form of 
"Industrial Revolutions". In corporatist
structures, those with influential 
positions in the structures are usually 
very well compensated in financial terms.
Those outside of the structures, however, 
are either not compensated whatsoever or 
compensated very little.

There was mention of the terms "Global South"
and "Global North" in the press about half a
year ago. Isn't that fantastic? I wonder how 
some people, here in the U.S., draw the lines
for the "Global North" and "Global South".
Maybe the lines are also drawn in U.S. territory,
which would mean that the U.S. practices
discrimination through controlling socio-economic 
factors, primarily occupation and income. There 
are so many great occupations in this world! It is 
too bad some people cannot  afford to, or are 
restricted in their movements and behaviors. The
term "Global South", from a corporatist context, 
fits the description of a region that produces 
initial components to more advanced technology, 
or one that deals a lot with physical natural 
resources, and whose labor force generally does
not require as much education. So in the 
hierarchy, there is the "Global South" under
the "Global North" in the cycle of 
labor-poduction-consumption. The "Global South"
is more populated and is not as potent, for 
lack of a better term, as the "Global North" 
because it labors and exists in the basic 
stages of the corporatist production system. 
The "Global North" takes advantage of the 
labor done by the "Global South" by using their
products for consumption or further development,
thereby saving time and resources for itself. 

The state of Florida is quite peculiar when one
considers it in the context of a corporatist 
structure. Florida does not have a developed 
electronics industry. Florida does not have 
as much legacy in the arts and sciences as the
state of California. Florida is not as 
conservative as Texas, overall. But overall, 
Florida is unremarkable. Florida is not really 
a follower or a leader, but a consumer. 
A big consumer because it has a big population. 
Many retirees in Florida are quite affluent, 
and although I do not know the statistics, 
much of their wealth must have been derived
from corporate matters. But those of working
age in Florida, even those that have credentials
past high school, tend to find it very difficult
to accumulate wealth. And it goes without saying, 
if wealth cannot be accumulated, then the benefit
of no state tax does not mean a thing. The state 
of Florida must have been planned and continue to 
be planned for a lot of recreational activity. 
And this is a problem for those that want to 
accumulate wealth or at least welfare by working
harder or innovating smarter. Corporatism seems 
to keep Florida Affluentaadis sailing on their 
cruise ships, and buries talent like treasure 
chests of gold.A terrible culture to utilize 
thought and effort. So some Florida residents 
are at the peaks of corporatist structures (typically old retirees), 
others are excluded from corporatist structures, and still
others are kept at the bottom of corporatist structures.
Diversity of status is not the problem; the issue is 
that Florida has an under-developed high-tech industry
and it rather buys products from the Valley (that is
Silicon Valley). 

My quality of life and human relations in Florida 
were not that great after I graduated from high 
school. There are definitely lackluster experiences 
in my living in the state of Florida since about 
adolescence. I already foreseen that I will really go nowhere 
if I continue to try to live in Florida. Bogged down, 
a marginal person, a person that does not need to be 
that smart or informed. Mr. Bottom-of-the-Corporatist-Structure.
And besides, when I think about Florida politics, I think 
about some of Niccolo Machiavelli's thinking that he wrote down 
in a book, calling it philosophy. Florida politics 
has a red side and a blue side, and is a sort of 
pay-to-play machine. Red politics in Florida is, 
from my perspective, split between the Italianos
& Hispanias and the Germanics. And blue politics in
Florida is comprised of hooligans and control freaks 
that use different styles but are ultimately of the
same caste. 

I generally do not like to delve into discussions about 
ethnicity, politics, and labor for many reasons, but 
the big reason is that many mouthfuls will be said 
although not much will be remembered let alone able to 
be constructively acted upon. The U.S. economic system 
is a very robust network, but not everyone has the same
level of convenience in choosing what they want to do 
for a living in accomodation to their self-identity.
What is quite obvious is that dysfunctional or disenfranchised
communities (perhaps based on ethnic identity) may find 
themselves in very unsettling, unproductive, and 
irrational situations depending on herd mentality and 
group leadership. Dysfunctional or disenfranchised 
communities may be too helpless to help themselves, and 
the poor souls that are touched by these dysfunctional 
or disenfranchised communities have difficult times 
moving on and solving pertinent problems that fit the 
worker's talents. The thought and initiative behind 
independence become like crusader legends. It seems 
that when leadership attempts to solve some issues 
in corporatistic arrangements or to solve issues 
using corporatism, issues such as identity,expression, 
and representation become constant topics for 
discussions and movements in response to deficits 
posed by certain occupational and financial 
attributes.

# More on Corporatism

Many people probably wonder what corporatism 
really is, because the definition and real-life 
exemplification require human perspectives to 
accomodate themselves to the different norms 
and sub-structures. 

Corporatism can be casual, but in a corporatist
structure, all persons and organizations bear some 
degree of connection to responsibilities regarding 
work restrictions, compensation, and long-term welfare.
For example, a farmer in a remote village produces 
dairy products dairy products, but needs crop products 
from another farmer. A contract is established between 
them that requires some monthly amount to be transported
according to a schedule consensually agreed on. Through
corporatism, the first farmer could produce their dairy 
and the other farmer has a long-term customer. 
Corporatism, in this case, ensures stability and 
cooperation.

There have been so-called "free" market failures 
due to the lack of corporatism. 
- country A wants to produce its own technology T
  but it did not think to promote social networks
  for its citizens to organize. So country A is stuck
  failing to produce technology T.
- An organization fails to improve its performance
  in hunting and farming, but it knows the solution.
  The organization fails to adopt the solution, and
  continues declining due to low performance.
- Several organizations compete with each other over
  the same scope of capital and influence. Instead of
  merging into conglomerates, they all fade into
  obsolescence from over-competition.
- Organization A produces goods G, but its security
  is so bad and it is weak on the legal ground; the
  organization let nation-state actors steal its
  intellectual property and goes bankrupt when the
  nation-state sold it to the competitors of A.
- Organizations operating in region R experience a violent
  takeover by invading militaries. Organizations fall under
  authority and possession of the invaders.

In each of these cases, the weaknesses of organizations
and networks that were supposed to uphold corporatist 
principles failed to maintain meaningful and positive 
bindings to each other. Issues such as sub-optimal 
levels of improvements and losses in competition could
have been minimalized if the structure had a sort of 
corporatist backup apparatus followed by a corporatist 
agenda.

Corporatist structures enable the rigidity necessary to 
minimalize disruptive practices, especially the ones that 
have weaponized subjectivity against organizational 
integrity. Corporatist structures can also be used to 
deter, subjugate, and entrap perceived threats into 
sub-prime conditions (i.e. working conditions, economic 
sanctions). Corporatist structures encourage objective 
measures on performance, in which these measures have 
reliable and available solutions for improvement. 
Corporatist structures tend to have two big objectives, 
and they are 
- scaling and growing
- enforcing compliance with terms of labor.
  
For the second objective, corporatist measures aim for
clarity in work processes, worker integration, and
maintaining order against potential sources of
disruption to the organizational body and/or leadership.
For corporatism to really work in a form more pure than 
not, there is the requirement of pro-corporatist agendas. 
Pro-corporatist actions through agenda may appear or be 
perceived as non-corporatist, anti-corporatist, but its 
actions that may or may not be rationally linked to the 
betterment of corporatism actually is a pivotal force 
behind the betterment. 

Corporatism has an umbrella of transparency, oversight 
in other words, that operates as a solution to filter out 
flukes and sub-functionals from legitimate entry, or any 
possible entry from a security perspective for that 
matter. Perceived threats are usually dealt with through 
socio-economic arrangements (think of personalized planned 
economies). Corporatism is an efficient and effective 
concept to manifest because it can aid in controlling 
narratives, a dominant role in the recognition and 
expression of problem and solution, and streamlining 
processes (removing duplicity, ascribing authority to 
singular sources as to avoid and preferably negate 
contradiction). Corporatist failings are a big cause of 
civil or violent conflicts.
